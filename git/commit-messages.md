# Git commit messages

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Example

	Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

	More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to
	about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first
	line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
	the text as the body.  The blank line separating the
	summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
	entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
	the two together.

	Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

	  - Bullet points are okay, too

	  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
	    preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
	    between, but conventions vary here
